## Why Understanding Apex Matters

### 📌 Description:

Apex is the proprietary programming language of Salesforce, similar to Java, used to implement business logic like triggers, classes, and batch processes. For SDETs, knowing Apex provides an edge in white-box testing, code review, and better understanding of the system’s inner workings.

### ➕ Benefits:

* Understand how business logic is implemented
* Create or modify unit/integration tests in Apex
* Contribute to static code analysis
* Debug failed test runs using Apex logs

### ⚠️ Limitations:

* Not transferable outside Salesforce
* Requires permissions and familiarity with Salesforce org setup

### 💬 Worth Learning?

✔️ Yes, especially for test engineers working closely with dev teams.

  <version>5.3.0</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

### ➕ Pros:

* Free and open-source
* Easy integration with CI/CD
